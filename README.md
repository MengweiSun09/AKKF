# AKKF
This project implements the Adaptive Kernel Kalman Filter (AKKF) for tracking a single target in non-linear, non-Gaussian environments using bearing-only radar data. The MATLAB code demonstrates AKKF's performance compared to a Bootstrap Particle Filter (PF), showcasing its accuracy and efficiency.
